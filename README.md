Regulatory compliance in software engineering is essential for ensuring the integrity, security,
and ethical use of software systems in various industries. In this project, we investigate the role
of three different Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to enhance the regulatory
compliance practices within the realm of software engineering, especially on Requirement
documents. Requirement documents, also known as requirements specifications, are formal
documents that outline the specifications, features, functionalities, and constraints of a software
system or product all written in natural language. NLP techniques offer innovative solutions for
automating compliance tasks, extracting relevant information from regulatory documents, and
analyzing requirement texts to ensure adherence to regulations. By leveraging NLP, software
engineers can develop advanced compliance monitoring systems, streamline regulatory reporting
processes, and proactively identify and mitigate compliance risks.
